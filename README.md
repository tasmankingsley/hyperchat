## Description
A simple live chatroom app. The app uses google authenication through firebase to enable the user to login. Once signed in the user can participate in an open chatroom with other authenticated users using firebase's firestore database.

## Technology stack
This app is built with the react framework, firebase (firestore, authenitication, and hosting), javascript, css, and html.

## Future considerations and implementations
Add additional sign in methods, add ability to delete messages, add more features similar to discord (ability to create own communities).
